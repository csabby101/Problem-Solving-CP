# Problem Solving and CP
This repository contains my solutions to problem sets from [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/), [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/), [HackerEarth](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/), [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard), [SPOJ](https://www.spoj.com/problems/classical/), [Atcoder](https://atcoder.jp/) and [CSES](https://cses.fi/problemset/). I'll keep adding solutions as and when I get time.

## Purpose of this repository :  
Firstly, I needed a version control system to track the changes I make to my codes over time. While problem solving, we often come across various methods(algorithms) that are quicker and more optimized than the previous version of our code.    
I sometimes revise these techniques and try to identify patterns from the archive of solutions I submit. This repository helps me to manage this approach more efficiently rather than creating copies and renaming versions.

## Can this repository help others in some way ?
Yes. If you are a competitive programmer or you just love problem solving, you can leverage this repository as a resource. You might stumble across this repo while searching for editorials to a problem bugging you since a long time (I'm counting on the SEO xD). You can refer to the code (parts of it) to construct your own solution.  
For each solution, I've added the problem link at the top as a comment. I might also add links to editorials or resources to learn the concepts required to solve that problem. Suggestions are welcome.

## Disclaimer :
**Code Readability** : I understand that the practice of writing clean code is extremely important for any aspiring software developer. But sometimes, especially in the sport of competitive programming, writing code faster becomes a priority over maintainability or readability.    
I think as long as programmers are aware of these differences and make sure that they learn the practices involved in software development along the way, they're good to go.
